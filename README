    missing API levels. In Eclipse, it can be launched by selecting
        Window --> Android SDK Manager 
B.  "NoClassDefFoundError" when running the client application. By default, the 
    ADT plugin does not export libraries included in the build. To correct this
    issue, right click on the project in Eclipse and open the Properties window.
